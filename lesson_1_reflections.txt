How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It was very helpful and was able to find the difference very easily

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It'll help me in knowing whatwere the changes implemented at each stage, and we can revert to any point easily in case if we want old settings.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual commit lets us save the file when we do any changes or when it is necessary to save a file. Autocommit might save the file at the end of the change or after certain time, in which we may be in middle of work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    As you told Git saves the whole Repositry(i.e file which consists of all the related files), this will help to update all the related files simultaneously which eradicates confusion while searching.
